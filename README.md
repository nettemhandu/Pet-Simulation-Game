# Pet-Simulation-Game
A fun interactive text-based game where users take care of virtual pets. Designed to demonstrate mastery of the four pillars of OOP:

Encapsulation: Pet attributes like hunger and happiness are private with controlled access

Inheritance: Subclasses (Dog, Cat, Bird) inherit from an abstract Pet class

Polymorphism: Methods like play() and makeSound() behave differently for each pet type.

Abstraction: Abstract Pet class defines essential pet behaviors that all pets implement.

Features a simple console based interaction loop to feed, play, and check pet stats.
Well-structured and easily extensible for new pets, items or gameplay mechanics.
